GAN on MedMNIST PathMNIST Dataset
📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch to generate synthetic medical images from the PathMNIST dataset, which is a part of the MedMNIST medical image benchmark. The goal is to learn a generative model that produces realistic medical histopathology images, which can aid in augmenting datasets for training robust deep learning models in medical applications.

📁 Dataset
Name: PathMNIST

Source: MedMNIST

Size: 107,180 colored images (28x28 RGB) across 9 classes representing different tissue types from gastrointestinal organs.

🧠 Model Architecture
Generator: A neural network that takes random noise as input and generates 28x28 RGB images.

Discriminator: A convolutional classifier that tries to distinguish real PathMNIST images from fake ones generated by the generator.

🧪 Features
Trains GAN with PyTorch.

Uses TensorBoard to visualize training loss and generated images.

Calculates Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) using a pretrained InceptionV3 model.

Supports data augmentation via torchvision transforms.
